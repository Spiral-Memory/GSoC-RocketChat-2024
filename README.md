## üìò Introduction

During my GSoC period, I worked on EmbeddedChat, a lightweight chat widget that uses the RocketChat engine's REST and real-time APIs to deliver comprehensive chat features, customizable options, and attractive theming capabilities.

## ‚≠ê Project Abstract

The goal of this project was to develop a ready-to-use chat solution that could be integrated into any website, web app, or mobile app. In EmbeddedChat 2024, my focus was on enhancing the UI by making components modular and providing pre-built themes. The project also sought to ensure security through HTTP-Only cookie-based authentication, using RC-app as a bridge. I also worked on improving configuration capabilities, enabling the instance to be configurable through RC-app, and developed a real-time layout editor with drag-and-drop features, among other enhancements.

## üö¢ Deliverables

- Redesign Embedded Chat for consistent CSS, logic separation, and monorepo component management.
- Upgrade theming system with prebuilt themes and enhanced customization.
- Boost security with HTTP-Only cookie authentication in Embedded Chat via RC-app.
- Enable admins to easily adjust all Embedded Chat settings in Rocket.Chat Workspace.
- Offer a drag-and-drop editor for admin UI configuration without coding.
- Enhance UI-Kit integration.
- Fix bugs and improve documentation.
